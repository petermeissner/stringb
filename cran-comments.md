# Your message:

Dear maintainer,

Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_stringb.html>.

Specifically, see the warnings about 'Documented arguments not in
\usage' in the r-devel checks.  These are from a recent bug fix
(PR#16223, see
<https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=16223>): can you
please fix your man pages as necessary?  (In most cases, remove the
documentation for argument '...'.)

Please correct before 2020-02-17 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

Best,
-k
