\description{
A generic function to write text to file (or a \link[base]{connections}) and
   accompanying methods that wrap \link[base]{writeLines} to do so. In contrast
   to vanilla writeLines() text_write() (1) is  a generic so methods, handling
   something else than character vectors, can be implemented (2) in contrast to
   writeLines()' default to transform to write text in the system locale
   text_write() will default to UTF-8 no matter the locale (3) furthermore this
   encoding can be changed to any encoding supported by \link[base]{iconv}
   (see also inconvlist \link[base]{iconv})
